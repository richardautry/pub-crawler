Sophisticated brewing techniques, yeast blends, and unique flavoring elements have elevated the beers of Belgium to the status enjoyed by wine in other countries. PranQster follows in this tradition using a mixed culture of antique yeast strains that produce a floral nose, a full fruity flavor, and a clean finish. Available in 12 oz 4-packs and 750 ml bottles.

PranQster has won the Gold for the best Belgian Style Pale Ale at the 2014 San Diego International Beer Competition. The judging was conducted by hops and barley loving industry professionals in a blind tasting. Already a four time gold medal winner, PranQster was awarded number five.

During the trials we brewed the beer in batches with a number of Belgian strains of yeast and sat down one day in 1995 to see which strain we liked the best. One of us poured two of the samples together and viola we had found the perfect blend of banana-like fruit and clove-like phenol character that we were looking for. It’s not an easy trick to propagate from two separate strains of yeast each time we brew the beer but the effort is well worth it. PranQster, like the originals from Belgium, is one-of-a kind!”        BREWERS NOTES From co-Brewmaster, Patrick Broderick, “PranQster was a fun beer to create.
